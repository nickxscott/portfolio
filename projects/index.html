                                <p>&#333vl was born out of a years-long obsession with the marathon. I always enjoyed the process of sitting down and planning out a training block for a big race - week by week, workout by workout. Understanding the puzzle of how to get in shape for a particular race was a challenge that I got continuously better at with each major race.</p> 
                                <p>Eventually, I had friends asking me to create training plans for them. I made a few plans in my traditional way, pulling out the spreadsheet and working my way through each week leading up to race day. It wasn't long before I started to see the patterns in how training blocks were structured, and as a programmer, I have a natural instinct when I see patterns in a process - automate it.</p> 
                                <p>I began working on a program that would create training plans from a few simple inputs: race date, race distance, goal pace, and number of weeks needed to train. Approximately 1 year later, I released &#333vl. The app creates training plans for runners preparing for the 5k, 10k, half-marathon, and marathon. It provides a dashboard with weekly training goals, mileage targets, workouts, and goal paces, and can send email reminders on a daily or weekly basis to keep you on track in your training block.</p>

The goal of the project was to understand daily market returns in the context of the past several years. It was a great refresher on z-scores, data visualization techniques, and of course, the flask framework for web app development. Check out the project and the source code at the links below.</p>
                                <p>NOTE: The free-tier of Render spins down apps after several minutes of no activity, which causes requests to be really slow if the app hasn't been opened for a while. Apologies in advance!</p>

                                <p>Discover Your Colleague is an app that I began developing for St. John's University beginning in the fall of 2023. The purpose of the app was to create a centralized tool to store, view, and search all faculty publication and grant activity across the university. The primary goal was to promote faculty collaboration across various departments and colleges at the institution, as well as allow department chairs and deans to monitor all new research and grants within their respective areas.</p>
                                <p>Users login with their St. John's credentials and can sync their <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a> profile to their DYC account. Once synced, all new publications that are added in ORCID are pulled into DYC on a nightly basis. Grants data was pulled from our core database and into the application as well. Additionally, the app includes a discussion forum in which users can discuss any and all matters related to research and grants.</p>
                                <p>The app was built using the Flask framework, and is hosted on Amazon ECS. The front-end was built with html/css/javascript, and Snowflake was used for all data integrations.</p>
                                <p>A link to the web app is provided below, though it is only accessible by current St. John's students and faculty. The code for the project is in a private repository</p>

                                <p>This is the first app I ever built. It calculates the average mile splits you need to run in order to finish a given race distance in a specified time. Many apps/calculators of this kind exist, but I wanted to see if I could write one myself from scratch. I still use this on a regular basis as I'm training for races and changing my goals throughout the training cycle. Sometimes the simplest tools are the most useful.</p>

                                <p>After reading Charles Petzold's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319" target="_blank">Code</a>, I became temporarily fascinated with varying-base numbering systems. As an exercise, I wanted to see if I could write a program from scratch that would convert base-10 integers into base-2 (binary) numbers. This was the second app I ever created, and the official start of my obsession with computing and using programming as a means of problem solving. The design of the app was also inspired by Code, and is an homage to the pioneers of the Turing machine.</p>
