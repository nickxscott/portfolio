        Inspired by the recent advancements in Natural Language Processing, I began developing an app that could generate concise summaries of textual documents of various size. The app uses LangChain, a new python library that allows developers to interact with LLMs in various ways. A interesting feature of LangChain is the ability to perform question-answering over documents, a feature which Summary AI relies on heavily. LangChain stores the uploaded documents in a vector database, which a user can then "query" with a prompt. LangChain finds the relevant information in the vector database, then sends the prompt along with the relevant info to an LLM of the developers choosing. In this case, I am using OpenAI's API to interact with Chat-GPT. When the user clicks "summarize", the app generates the prompt "summarize this document in under 100 words". <br>
        This app is still in development, and the code is currently in a private repo.<br><br>
